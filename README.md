# Bee Shooting Game

## Introduction
This is a simple arcade-style shooting game developed using WPF and C#. You control a spaceship that can move left and right, shooting incoming enemy bees. The bees descend in waves and may shoot back at you. Your goal is to score points by hitting enemies while avoiding getting shot. 

The game can be extended with multiple levels, waves, bosses, score tables, sound effects, and more.

## Gameplay
- You control a spaceship that can only move horizontally (left and right).
- Continuously shoot to eliminate incoming bee enemies.
- Enemy bees approach in waves, descending towards you and possibly shooting bullets.
- Hitting enemies increases your score.
- Being hit by enemy bullets decreases your lives/health.

## Features & Future Enhancements
- Multiple stages and waves
- Boss fights at certain levels
- Score ranking tables
- Sound effects and background music
- Power-ups and special weapons (planned)

## Controls
- Use **A / D** keys to move the spaceship left and right.
